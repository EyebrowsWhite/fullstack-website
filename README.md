# This is a simple website using graphql

## run
- `npm run build`
- `npm run backend`
- `npm run frontend`

This project is a practice project for me to learn graphql using `react` `express` `apollo-graphql` and `esbuild`.

I use mock data in backend because i am not familar with docker, and there are many messy codes, it will be improved later.


## todo

- [ ] deploy a demo, may be it can be my personal website
- [ ] check the react-router and server config, it's messy
- [ ] esbuild is not very good on css module and code splitting, try vite(dont want to use webpack, it is really slow)
- [ ] learn docker and set a development database, and it will be completed
